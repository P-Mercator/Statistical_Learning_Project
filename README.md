# Statistical_Learning_Project

The repository was created in order four our team of 4 Big Data Analytics graduate students to share ideas and code to complete the main and only assignment of our Statistical Learning course. You can find a copy report [HERE](). 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to recognise hand postures from grayscale photographs. There are over 4800 images with 6 different types of hand postures (see fig. 1), from 10 different persons. The variables of each image will either be pixels or area of the image with its grayscale intensity. The data will be downloaded from S. Marcel collection of images.

The idea came to us as the analysis of images implies very high dimensionality of data and will require dimension reduction. As none of us has been working with the analysis of images and we all wish to understand better how to extract information from other kinds of data, this dataset/analysis seemed best suited to this project and our curiosity.
To achieve this, we are going to apply data manipulation techniques such as cropping/scaling, normalisation and vectorisation along with dimensionality reduction (PCA and image gradient filter). Following this supervised statistical learning methods such as logistic regression, KNN, random forest and neural network will allow us to classify those images.
